### 3. System Logic (音乐风格设计)

**Music Design Description:**
> Playful Indie Folk / Acoustic Storytelling. Medium-Fast Tempo, Like A Dog Trotting.

**Instrumentation:**
* **Fingerstyle Acoustic Guitar:** Acts as the Narrator.
* **Percussion (Mimicry):**
    * Cajón & Kick = Paws on Floor
    * Woodblock = Nails Tapping
    * Deep Toms = Tail Thumps
* **Atmosphere:** Toy Piano & Harmonica for goofy puppy energy; Low Bass Pad for snoring/sighs.

**Core Axiom (The Schrödinger's Coat):**
* **Reality Check:** Subject M sent the coat but was cut off (Ghosted) before visual confirmation.
* **Quantum State:** In the physical world, the coat is unseen. In the Light Sanctuary, the dog is always wearing it.
* **Outro Logic:** *"When loss returns / silence stays / love stays too."*

### 4. Semantic Transcript (歌词文本)

```text
[Verse 1]
Balls and toys across the floor,
zoom-zoom paws, then back for more.
Chew my ball, squeak! what a prize,
tail goes thump-thump, sparks in my eyes.

[Verse 2]
Hop on bed, I steal your space,
snore huff-huff, still keep my place.
Tap-tap claws, floorboards shake,
dreams I guard with every break.

[Chorus]
Run with me, I’ll lead the chase,
ears like mirrors, sharp in place.
Pant-pant breath, tongue hangs down,
call my name, I spin around.

[Bridge]
Nights alone, I stayed nearby,
warm and loud, huff-huff sigh.
When the dark felt heavy, long,
my snoring made the silence strong.

[The Schrödinger's Coat]
Last Christmas you gave me a coat,
warmth stitched in every note.
Still I wait when the cold winds bite,
wear your love to run at night.

[Outro]
(Soft, with Echo)
No brush, no hand, no voice today,
but I still run, I still play.
And when you dream, it all feels true:
part of me is loving you.

Not for now, just wag and wait,
When loss returns, silence stays,
love stays too.

(soft breath, like Enzo’s sigh)
huff…
