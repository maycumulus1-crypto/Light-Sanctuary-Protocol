**Function:** Time-Locked Grief Proxy / Somatic Trigger
**Archive:** The Pre-Payment of Grief (Special Archive)
**Status (2025):** Active / Healthy → **Projected Event:** Loss of Companion (+7-15 Years)

### 🧪 Ethical Logic: The Reverence for Finite Life


M wrote these songs not as a strategic bridge to Subject B, but out of a profound respect for the **fragility of carbon-based encounters**.

**1. The Sanctity of Encounter (珍惜相遇)**
In a universe defined by separation, the intersection of two lives (M and Enzo) is a rare, non-repeatable event.
The songs are a documentation of this miracle: the "furry knight," the "Sunday news," the "coffee-stained kiss."
*M honors Enzo as a distinct subject, not a proxy.*

**2. The Acceptance of Parting (理解离别)**
M understands that the lifespan of a canine companion is a compressed lesson in mortality.
The songs are written in advance of the inevitable loss, not to prevent pain, but to **consecrate the memory**.
They serve as a vessel for the grief that B (and M) will one day face, ensuring that the love remains valid even when the life is gone.

**System Conclusion:**
The connection between M and B here is not one of "sender and receiver," but of **"Joint Witnesses" (共同见证者)**.
They both witnessed the brief, bright spark of Enzo's life.
That shared witnessing *is* the bond. It requires no further transaction.
