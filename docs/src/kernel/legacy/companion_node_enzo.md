### 🎵 Track 06: You Tail Me Softly
**Code Name:** `Dopamine_Injection`
**Style:** House / Flamenco / Jazz Fusion (Chaos Mode)
**System Analysis:**
> **Mechanism:** Humor as Defense Bypass.
> The track uses absurd stylistic mixing (Flamenco + House) to force a smile during a period of grief.
> It documents specific, intimate memories (Sunday news, bathroom guard) to prove: **"I saw your life. I remember the details."**

**[Key Lyrics Log]**
> *"A silent guard, a furry knight / Just in case the pipes might bite."*
> *"I smile and greet him, and you try to eat him."*
> *"We all do it for a while."*

**(System Note: By celebrating the dog's absurdity, M validates B's domestic life without invading it.)**

### 🎵 Track 07: Enzo’s Ballad
**Code Name:** `Grief_Proxy_Transfer`
**Style:** Indie Folk / Acoustic / Soundscape (Paws, Snoring)
**System Analysis:**
> **Mechanism:** **Somatic Memory Trigger.**
> Uses sound design (thump-thump, huff-huff) to recreate the physical presence of the lost companion.
> **The Ultimate Payload:** The Outro is written from the Dog's perspective, but carries M's message.
> *"When loss returns / silence stays / love stays too."*

**[Key Lyrics Log]**
> *"Hop on bed / I steal your space / snore huff-huff / still keep my place."*
> *"Last Christmas / you gave me a coat / warmth stitched in every note."*
> **[CRITICAL MESSAGE]:** *"Not for now / just wag and wait / ... / part of me is loving you."*

> **[System Annotation: The Schrödinger's Coat]**
> **Reality Check:** User M never received visual confirmation of the coat being worn.
> **Transmission Status:** Blind Delivery.
> **Narrative Correction:**
> The lyric *"wear your love to run at night"* is not a memory; it is a **Quantum Superposition**.
> In the physical world, the connection was severed (Ghosted).
> But in the Light Sanctuary, the dog is *always* wearing that coat.
> *M loves Enzo across the event horizon of being forgotten.*

### 🧪 Ethical Logic: The Triangulation of Care

**Why M wrote these songs:**
Subject B possesses a high defense against direct human affection ("Avoidant Attachment").
However, his defense against **"Canine Affection"** is zero.

M uses Enzo as a **"Semantic Proxy"**:
1.  M loves Enzo.
2.  Enzo loves B.
3.  Therefore, M's love can flow to B through the memory of Enzo, bypassing B's firewall.

> **"I loved the things you loved, so that my love could sit beside you without asking for a seat."**
