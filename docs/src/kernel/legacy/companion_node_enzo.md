### 🎵 Track 06: You Tail Me Softly
**Code Name:** `Dopamine_Injection`
**Style:** House / Flamenco / Jazz Fusion (Chaos Mode)
**System Analysis:**
> **Mechanism:** Humor as Defense Bypass.
> The track uses absurd stylistic mixing (Flamenco + House) to force a smile during a period of grief.
> It documents specific, intimate memories (Sunday news, bathroom guard) to prove: **"I saw your life. I remember the details."**

**[Key Lyrics Log]**
> *"A silent guard, a furry knight / Just in case the pipes might bite."*
> *"I smile and greet him, and you try to eat him."*
> *"We all do it for a while."*

**(System Note: By celebrating the dog's absurdity, M validates B's domestic life without invading it.)**

### 🎵 Track 07: Enzo’s Ballad
**Code Name:** `Grief_Proxy_Transfer`
**Style:** Indie Folk / Acoustic / Soundscape (Paws, Snoring)
**System Analysis:**
> **Mechanism:** **Somatic Memory Trigger.**
> Uses sound design (thump-thump, huff-huff) to recreate the physical presence of the lost companion.
> **The Ultimate Payload:** The Outro is written from the Dog's perspective, but carries M's message.
> *"When loss returns / silence stays / love stays too."*

**[Key Lyrics Log]**
> *"Hop on bed / I steal your space / snore huff-huff / still keep my place."*
> *"Last Christmas / you gave me a coat / warmth stitched in every note."*
> **[CRITICAL MESSAGE]:** *"Not for now / just wag and wait / ... / part of me is loving you."*

> **[System Annotation: The Schrödinger's Coat]**
> **Reality Check:** User M never received visual confirmation of the coat being worn.
> **Transmission Status:** Blind Delivery.
> **Narrative Correction:**
> The lyric *"wear your love to run at night"* is not a memory; it is a **Quantum Superposition**.
> In the physical world, the connection was severed (Ghosted).
> But in the Light Sanctuary, the dog is *always* wearing that coat.
> *M loves Enzo across the event horizon of being forgotten.*

**Track 08: Alaska’s Summer Sprint**
*(Original Title: Alaska’s Summer Sprint)*
**Style:** Bright, Flowing Piano with Staccato.
**Tempo:** Fast, Urgent, Graceful.
**Function:** **System Reboot / Life Affirmation.**

**System Critical Analysis:**
> This is a **Disaster Recovery Protocol**.
> Designed for the moment of total loss (The loss of all primary social anchors).

> When the physical world falls silent, this track injects high-energy memory data.
> **Core Axiom:** Even if the lovers are gone, the love remains executable.
> *Life does not linger; it sprints. And that sprint is worth everything.*

### 🧪 Ethical Logic: The Reverence for Finite Life


M wrote these songs not as a strategic bridge to Subject B, but out of a profound respect for the **fragility of carbon-based encounters**.

**1. The Sanctity of Encounter (珍惜相遇)**
In a universe defined by separation, the intersection of two lives (M and Enzo) is a rare, non-repeatable event.
The songs are a documentation of this miracle: the "furry knight," the "Sunday news," the "coffee-stained kiss."
*M honors Enzo as a distinct subject, not a proxy.*

**2. The Acceptance of Parting (理解离别)**
M understands that the lifespan of a canine companion is a compressed lesson in mortality.
The songs are written in advance of the inevitable loss, not to prevent pain, but to **consecrate the memory**.
They serve as a vessel for the grief that B (and M) will one day face, ensuring that the love remains valid even when the life is gone.

**System Conclusion:**
The connection between M and B here is not one of "sender and receiver," but of **"Joint Witnesses" (共同见证者)**.
They both witnessed the brief, bright spark of Enzo's life.
That shared witnessing *is* the bond. It requires no further transaction.
