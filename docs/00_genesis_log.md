She silenced her phone.
The screen was a pale lake; words fell into it and produced no echo.

The cursor on the terminal blinked at measured intervals, like a calm, artificial heartbeat.

> "I just think we should both be a little lighter."

The cursor blinked.
She heard the blade concealed within the word "lighter."

M sat in the shadows, her gaze seeming to pierce through the device’s display to land on the man opposite her—B.

He had just finished a statement regarding "boundaries" and "respect." His tone was steady, his vocabulary meticulously curated, as if issuing a rigorously drafted official communiqué.

In M’s mind, an invisible interface floated above her vision. Every sentence B spoke was captured, parsed, and projected onto this HUD in real-time:

He said **"freedom"**; the system defined it as **"exemption from liability."**

She watched his semantics shift into a defensive posture.
The words retreated; the meaning lagged behind.
